# PizzeriaOnline
<p>Pizzeria-Online is a full-stack mobile and web application for a gastronomic restaurant consisting of two front-end applications: one for the customer, the other for the restaurant staff. The system allows the customer to create an account, which is optional, make an order, add reviews and maintain a profile where one have access to order history and comments. The customer can also use the application without registration, but loses certain additional functionalities like order tracking or ordering with prefilled data. On the other hand, the staff application enables real-time order and request tracking, where you can receive and edit the order status and thus inform the customer about the progress.
